# alertme
Script to monitor  for changes in websites and send an email and/or tweet when one is detected

requires requests (python -m pip install requests)

uses python 2 (cry about it - if it really means that much to you someone fork it and add parentheses to the print statements)

note:it was made to work universally so of course it will not work on every site and will freak out on some(IE sites that change what content is displayed frequently/constantly)but at the advantage of being able to be used on a variety of sites / pages. Personally used it on bronze56k and DSM E-Shop before but it works on alot of different ones.
